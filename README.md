## Butterfly Option Pricing with Monte Carlo Simulation

This project prices a butterfly spread option using Monte Carlo simulation with antithetic variates for variance reduction.

**Methods Used**
- Butterfly option payoff structure
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Antithetic variates variance reduction
- Confidence interval estimation
